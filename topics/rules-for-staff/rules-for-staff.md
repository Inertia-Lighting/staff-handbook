## Rules for Staff
Staff are expected to:
- use common sense.
- be responsible for their actions.
- properly answer questions and resolve issues.
- report unacceptable behavior to upper-level staff.
- [enforce our rules](../enforcement-of-rules/enforcement-of-rules.md) and follow it themselves.
- follow the [chain of command](../chain-of-command/chain-of-command.md).
- follow instructions given by higher-level staff.  
  As an example, if a higher-level staff member tells you to change your nickname, you will do it without complaining.
- be respectful, professional, and courteous.  
  As an example, staff should not use unprofessional language when communicating with anyone.
- maintain a consistent and professional appearance.  
  As an example, staff should not use unprofessional nicknames.
- ensure and respect confidentiality of hidden content whenever possible.  
  As an example, messages sent in **#staff-chat** should not be shared with individuals that lack access to **#staff-chat**.  
  The same logic applies to direct messages.
- do not tell higher-level staff how to do their job.

## Failure to Comply
Failure to comply with these rules will result in an appropriate action being taken.  
Appropriate actions may include but are not limited to:
- demotion
- suspension
- termination
