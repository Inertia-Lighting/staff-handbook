## Rules for Staff
Staff are expected to:
- read, understand, and adhere to all aspects of this handbook.
- use common sense.
- be responsible for their actions.
- properly answer questions and resolve issues.
- report suspicious / unacceptable behavior to higher-level staff.
- [enforce our rules](../enforcement-of-rules/enforcement-of-rules.md) and follow it themselves.
- follow the [chain of command](../chain-of-command/chain-of-command.md).
- follow instructions given by higher-level staff.  
  As an example, if a higher-level staff member tells you to change your nickname, you will do it without complaining.
- be respectful, professional, and courteous.  
  As an example, staff should not use unprofessional language when communicating with anyone.
- maintain a consistent and professional appearance.  
  As an example, staff should not use unprofessional nicknames.
- ensure and respect confidentiality of hidden content whenever possible.

  The same logic applies to direct messages.
- don't tell company management how to do their jobs.
