## Description

The customer service team is responsible for support, community engagement, 
feedback, and making connections with customers. This team is the first set of people our customers will contact when they need help, as a result, creating the job of our team is very important as first impressions are key to a good start. 

## Responsibilities

- Demonstrate consistent activity on the server, engaging with members, participating in development discussions, and actively spending time in Discord.
- Provide timely responses to live support threads, ensuring prompt assistance to customers.
- Attend scheduled staff meetings and promptly notify upper staff if unable to attend.
- Maintain proactive and effective communication with upper staff and lower staff.
- Be professional when interacting with customers and community members, adhere to common-sense rules such as using proper grammar and avoid using profanity or slang.
- Offer valuable feedback on various aspects of the community, including products, customers, staff, and support tickets.

## Inactivity

Respond promptly to any communication from leadership/peers.
Not responding within a 2-day period without prior notification of scheduled inactivity, will result in you being marked inactive.
You will then have 5 days to rectify the situation before being removed from the position.
