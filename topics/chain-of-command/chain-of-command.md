## Chain of Command
1. [Company Management](./company-management.md)
2. [Team Leaders](./team-leaders.md)
3. [Moderation](./moderation.md)  
   [Development](./developers.md)  
   [Public Relations](./public-relations.md)  
   [Customer Service](./customer-service.md)  

## Responsibilities
Staff members are expected to follow the chain of command.  
Following the chain of command allows for our staff team to be efficient and effective.  
Whenever possible, staff members should reach out to the next level of the chain of command instead of reaching out directly to Company Management.

**Good Examples:**
- > OrangeDragonSlayer (Moderator) has an urgent question, they ask an Admin, no response was given in a timely manner, then they ask a relevant Team Leader.

- > TonyTheTiger (Junior Developer) wishes to implement a new feature for a codebase that they have access to, first they ask a Lead Developer who is in-charge of the codebase.

- > MrBoomFantastic (Administrator) notices that Fisherman32 (Moderator) is having difficulties in assisting a member of our community, MrBoomFantastic proceeds to discretely message Fisherman32 on what they could do to help.

**Bad Examples:**
- > ToasterBath72 (Moderator) has a non-urgent question, they ask Company Management in 27 separate messages that ping each time.

  ToasterBath72 should talk to a Team Leader before resorting to Company Management, (also don't ping 27 times ðŸ˜‰).

- > ProgrammerGod69 (Junior Developer) modifies an existing codebase without permission.

  All developers are expected to notify and ask for permission from a Lead Developer who is in charge of the codebase.  
  Adding to that, any new projects must be approved by the Head of Development.

- > Snowball (Moderator) tells a higher-level member of staff:  
    >> Do you want a cookie?  
    >> I don't know why you think that means anything.  
    >> Just because you're a Team Leader doesn't mean that you are better than everyone.  
    >  
    >> Do you think that I give a fuck?  
    >> Use your ears and listen to me!
    >  
    >> I've had enough of this...  
    >> I'm not listening to you anymore.  

  In this example, Snowball is being extraordinarily rude, unhelpful, and unprofessional.  
  Doing what Snowball did, is not appropriate, and may result in termination from being a member of staff.

- > EntitledKaren (Administrator) rudely tells Company Management how to do their jobs.
