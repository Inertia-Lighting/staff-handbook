## Chain of Command
1. [Company Management](./company-management.md)
2. [Team Leaders](./team-leaders.md)
3. [Administrators and Moderators](./administrators-and-moderators.md)
4. [Developers](./developers.md)  
   [Marketing and Media](./marketing-and-media.md)  
   [Customer Support](./customer-support.md)

## Responsibilities
Staff members are expected to follow the chain of command.

Good Examples:
- > OrangeDragonSlayer (Moderator) has an urgent question, they ask an Admin, no response was given in a timely manner, then they ask a relevant Team Leader.

- > Tony (Junior Developer) wishes to implement a new feature for a codebase that they have access to, first they ask the Lead Developer who is in-charge of the codebase.

- > Connie (Administrator) notices that Bonk (Moderator) is having difficulties in assisting a member of our community, Connie proceeds to discretely message Bonk on what they could do to help.

Bad Examples:
- > DjHardly (Moderator) has a non-urgent question, they ask Company Management in 27 separate messages that ping each time.

  You should talk to a Team Leader before resorting to Company Management, (also don't ping 27 times ðŸ˜‰).

- > NotCreatorWill (Junior Developer) modifies an existing codebase without permission.

  All developers are expected to notify and ask for permission from a Lead Developer who is in charge of the codebase.  
  Adding to that, any new projects must be approved by the Head of Developers.

- > EntitledKaren (Administrator) rudely tells Company Management how to do their jobs.

  In situations such as this, we refer you to the image below.
