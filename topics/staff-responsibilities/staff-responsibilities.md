## Introduction
Inertia Lighting staff have a responsibility to create, uphold, and harbor a safe space for our community to engage and flourish in.

In pursuit of that goal, this handbook has been created to provide a resource for all staff (and the community) to be able to read.

## Responsibilities

Their position involves creating graphics, and advertising the group, to engage with our members to give the best service possible.
