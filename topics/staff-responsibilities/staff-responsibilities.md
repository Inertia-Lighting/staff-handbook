## Introduction
Inertia Lighting staff have a responsibility to create, uphold, and harbor a safe space for our community to engage and flourish in.

In order to do just that, we want our users and staff to feel wanted and welcome while interacting with each other.

It is important for our staff to understand that although people may have differing viewpoints on life, we know that the LGBTQ+ community deserves respect for their human rights and deserve to not be discriminated against. With that in mind, it is the responsibility of our staff to help ensure that our users also respect the LGBTQ+ community.
