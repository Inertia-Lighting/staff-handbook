## Introduction
Inertia Lighting staff have a responsibility to create, uphold, and harbor a safe space for our community to engage and flourish in.  
In pursuit of that goal, this handbook has been created to provide a resource for all staff (and the community) to be able to read.

# Expectation of Active Participation
As a member of staff, you are expected to provide a minimum of three (3) hours per week towards Inertia.
If you are in multiple departments, you are expected to spread your available time to all of your roles in Inertia.
Expected hours may be altered at discretion of Company Management.

## Responsibilities
- ### Company Management
    - Company Management exists to manage all aspects of the community and company, you can think of Company Management as Owners.
- ### Team Leaders
    - Team Leaders are the head of each team that they oversee, and are expected to carry out what is given to them by Company Management.
    - Being a Team Leader is a tough gig... Some people don't like it, but you are incredibly important part of keeping our teams productive, healthy, and most importantly: respected by of our community.
- ### Administrators and Moderators
    - Administrators and Moderators are the sword/shield of our staff team that exist to uphold our rules and keep our community safe.
    - Remember that having the power to wield a sword/shield doesn't mean that you should always use it.
- ### Developers
    - Developers are the building blocks that enabled us get where we are and are the driving force behind what our community loves.
    - They create everything: from our website to our products; that our users interact with on a daily basis.
      ```lua
      local requestedFeatures = 1

      local function createRequestedFeature()
          requestedFeatures -= 1 -- another one bites the dust
      end

      while requestedFeatures > 1 do
          createRequestedFeature()
          requestedFeatures += 2 -- oh no 2 more requested features
      end
      ```
- ### Marketing and Media
    - Marketing and Media are a necessary evil, one that exists to ensure our viability to the community and our continuance into the future
    - They are responsible for creating graphics, videos, and ensuring that our community / products are marketable.
    - Just don't pull a Discord re-branding on us ;).
- ### Customer Support
    - Customer Support are the unsung heroes of Inertia Lighting, and are the glue that keeps our community together.
    - They assist our community in our server and support tickets to ensure that all members are satisfied with our products and services.
